       "        Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used reliable, non-invasive approach for cardiovascular disease diagnosis. With the rapid growth of ECG examinations and the insufficiency of cardiologists, accurate and automatic diagnosis of ECG signals has become a hot research topic. Deep learning methods have demonstrated promising results in predictive <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> tasks. In this paper, we developed a deep neural network for multi-label classification of cardiac arrhythmias in 12-lead ECG recordings. Experiments on a public 12-lead ECG dataset showed the effectiveness of our method. The proposed model achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.970 and an average F1 score of 0.813. The deep model showed superior performance than 4 machine learning methods learned from extracted expert features. Besides, the deep models trained on single-lead ECGs produce lower performance than using all 12 leads simultaneously. The best-performing leads are lead I, aVR, and V5 among 12 leads. Finally, we employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the model's behavior at both patient level and population level. Our code is freely available at https://github.com/onlyzdd/ecg-diagnosis.\n",

It might result in a high risk to individual and health information handling rights and opportunities unless there is a palatable defense. Reasonable security standards are needed to protect electronic health records (EHR). All personal data handling needs adequate explanation. Maintaining access to medical data even in the developing world would favor health and well-being across the world. Unfortunately, there are still countries that hinder the portability of medical records. Numerous occurrences have shown that it still takes weeks for the medical data to be ported from one general physician (GP) to another. Cross border portability is nearly impossible due to the lack of technical infrastructure and standardization. We demonstrate the difficulty of the portability of medical records with some example case studies as a collaborative engagement exercise through a data mapping process to describe how different people and datapoints interact and evaluate EHR portability techniques. We then propose a blockchain-based EHR system that allows secure, and cross border sharing of medical data. The ethical and technical challenges around having such a system have also been discussed in this study.\n",

These help understand the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> burden posed by a pandemic and respond accordingly. However, the problem of how college/university campuses should function during a pandemic is new for the following reasons:(i) social contact in colleges are structured and can be engineered for chosen objectives, (ii) the last pandemic to cause such societal disruption was over 100 years ago, when higher education was not a critical part of society, (ii) not much was known about causes of pandemics, and hence effective ways of safe operations were not known, and (iii) today with distance learning, remote operation of an academic institution is possible. Our approach is unique in presenting a flexible simulation system, containing a suite of model libraries, one for each major component. The system integrates agent based modeling (ABM) and stochastic network approach, and models the interactions among individual entities, e.g., students, instructors, classrooms, residences, etc. in great detail. For each decision to be made, the system can be used to predict the impact of various choices, and thus enable the administrator to make informed decisions. While current approaches are good for infection modeling, they lack accuracy in social contact modeling. Our ABM approach, combined with ideas from Network Science, presents a novel approach to contact modeling. A detailed case study of the University of Minnesota's Sunrise Plan is presented. For each decisions made, its impact was assessed, and results used to get a measure of confidence. We believe this flexible tool can be a valuable asset for various kinds of organizations to assess their infection risks in pandemic-time operations, including middle and high schools, factories, warehouses, and small/medium sized businesses.\n",

The most obvious and pressing challenge is taking care of acutely ill patients while managing spread of infection within the care facility, but this is just the tip of the iceberg if we consider what could be done to prepare in advance for future pandemics. Beyond the obvious need for strengthening medical knowledge and preparedness, there is a complementary need to anticipate and address the engineering challenges associated with infectious disease emergencies. Robotic technologies are inherently programmable, and robotic systems have been adapted and deployed, to some extent, in the current crisis for such purposes as transport, logistics, and disinfection. As technical capabilities advance and as the installed base of robotic systems increases in the future, they could play a much more significant role in future crises. This report is the outcome of a virtual workshop co-hosted by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held on July 9-10, 2020. The workshop consisted of over forty participants including representatives from the engineering/robotics community, clinicians, critical care workers, public health and safety experts, and emergency responders. It identifies key challenges faced by <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> responders and the general population and then identifies robotic/technological responses to these challenges. Then it identifies the key research/knowledge barriers that need to be addressed in developing effective, scalable solutions. Finally, the report ends with the following recommendations on how to implement this strategy.\n",

Wound classification is a key step in wound diagnosis that would help clinicians to identify an optimal treatment procedure. Hence, having a high-performance classifier assists the specialists in the field to classify the wounds with less financial and time costs. Different machine learning and deep learning-based wound classification methods have been proposed in the literature. In this study, we have developed an ensemble Deep Convolutional Neural Network-based classifier to classify wound images including surgical, diabetic, and venous ulcers, into multi-classes. The output classification scores of two classifiers (patch-wise and image-wise) are fed into a Multi-Layer Perceptron to provide a superior classification performance. A 5-fold cross-validation approach is used to evaluate the proposed method. We obtained maximum and average classification accuracy values of 96.4% and 94.28% for binary and 91.9\\% and 87.7\\% for 3-class classification problems. The results show that our proposed method can be used effectively as a decision support system in classification of wound images or other related clinical applications.\n",

Internet of Health Things (IoHT) networks have privacy requirements within a <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> setting. However, these networks have unique challenges and security requirements (integrity, authentication, privacy and availability) must also be balanced with the need to maintain efficiency in order to conserve battery power, which can be a significant limitation in IoHT devices and networks. Data are usually transferred without undergoing filtering or optimization, and this traffic can overload sensors and cause rapid battery consumption when interacting with IoHT networks. This consequently poses restrictions on the practical implementation of these devices. As a solution to address the issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving two-tier data inference framework, this can conserve battery consumption by reducing the data size required to transmit through inferring the sensed data and can also protect the sensitive data from leakage to adversaries. Results from experimental evaluations on privacy show the validity of the proposed scheme as well as significant data savings without compromising the accuracy of the data transmission, which contributes to energy efficiency of IoHT sensor devices.\n",

EHR data are typically stored in a relational database, which can also be converted to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), allowing two approaches for EHR QA: Table-based QA and Knowledge Graph-based QA. We hypothesize that the graph-based approach is more suitable for EHR QA as graphs can represent relations between entities and values more naturally compared to tables, which essentially require JOIN operations. To validate our hypothesis, we first construct EHR QA datasets based on MIMIC-III, where the same question-answer pairs are represented in SQL (table-based) and SPARQL (graph-based), respectively. We then test a state-of-the-art EHR QA model on both datasets where the model demonstrated superior QA performance on the SPARQL version. Finally, we open-source both MIMICSQL* and MIMIC-SPARQL* to encourage further EHR QA research in both direction\n",

Smart garment is a specific wearable which can be used for smart <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span>. There are various smart garments that help users to monitor their body vitals in real-time. Many commercially available garments collect the vital data and transmit it to the mobile application for visualization. However, these don't perform real-time analysis for the user to comprehend their health conditions. Also, such garments are not included with an alert system to alert users and contacts in case of emergency. In MyWear, we propose a wearable body vital monitoring garment that captures physiological data and automatically analyses such heart rate, stress level, muscle activity to detect abnormalities. A copy of the physiological data is transmitted to the cloud for detecting any abnormalities in heart beats and predict any potential heart failure in future. We also propose a deep neural network (DNN) model that automatically classifies abnormal heart beat and potential heart failure. For immediate assistance in such a situation, we propose an alert system that sends an alert message to nearby medical officials. The proposed MyWear has an average accuracy of 96.9% and precision of 97.3% for detection of the abnormalities.\n",

In this work we are investigating ways to analyze the data available through EDGAR database. This may serve portfolio managers (pension funds, mutual funds, insurance, hedge funds) to get automated insights into companies they invest in, to better manage their portfolios. The analysis is based on Artificial Neural Networks applied to the data.} In particular, one of the most popular machine learning methods, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, originally developed to interpret and classify images, is now being used to interpret financial data. This work investigates the best way to input data collected from the SEC filings into a CNN architecture. We incorporate accounting principles and mathematical methods into the design of three image encoding methods. Specifically, two methods are derived from accounting principles (Sequential Arrangement, Category Chunk Arrangement) and one is using a purely mathematical technique (Hilbert Vector Arrangement). In this work we analyze fundamental financial data as well as financial ratio data and study companies from the financial, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> and IT sectors in the United States. We find that using imaging techniques to input data for CNN works better for financial ratio data but is not significantly better than simply using the 1D input directly for fundamental data. We do not find the Hilbert Vector Arrangement technique to be significantly better than other imaging techniques.\n",

       "        The recent series of innovations in deep learning (DL) have shown enormous potential to impact individuals and society, both positively and negatively. The DL models utilizing massive computing power and enormous datasets have significantly outperformed prior historical benchmarks on increasingly difficult, well-defined research tasks across technology domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, signal processing, and human-computer interactions. However, the Black-Box nature of DL models and their over-reliance on massive amounts of data condensed into labels and dense representations poses challenges for interpretability and explainability of the system. Furthermore, DLs have not yet been proven in their ability to effectively utilize relevant domain knowledge and experience critical to human understanding. This aspect is missing in early data-focused approaches and necessitated knowledge-infused learning and other strategies to incorporate computational knowledge. This article demonstrates how knowledge, provided as a knowledge graph, is incorporated into DL methods using knowledge-infused learning, which is one of the strategies. We then discuss how this makes a fundamental difference in the interpretability and explainability of current approaches, and illustrate it with examples from natural language processing for <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> and education applications.\n",

SUMO further generates an extractive summary by presenting a diversified set of sentences from the documents that explain its decision on the correctness of the textual claim. Prior approaches to address the problem of fact checking and evidence extraction have relied on simple concatenation of claim and document word embeddings as an input to claim driven attention weight computation. This is done so as to extract salient words and sentences from the documents that help establish the correctness of the claim.

       "        Bacterial colonization ofimplanted biomedical devicesis themain cause of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span>-associated infections, estimated to be 8.8 million per year in Europe. Many infections originate from damaged skin, which lets microorganisms exploit injuries and surgical accesses as passageways to reach the implant site and inner organs. Therefore, an effective treatment of skin damage is highly desirable for the success of many biomaterial-related surgical procedures. Due to gained resistance to antibiotics, new antibacterial treatments are becoming vital to control nosocomial infections arising as surgical and post-surgical complications. Surface coatings can avoid biofouling and bacterial colonization thanks to biomaterial inherent properties (e.g., super hydrophobicity), specifically without using drugs, which may cause bacterial resistance. The focus of this review is to highlight the emerging role of degradable polymeric micro- and nano-structures that show intrinsic antifouling and antimicrobial properties, with a special outlook towards biomedical applications dealing with skin and skin damage. The intrinsic properties owned by the biomaterials encompass three main categories: (1) physical-mechanical, (2) chemical, and (3) electrostatic. Clinical relevance in ear prostheses and breast implants is reported. Collecting and discussing the updated outcomes in this field would help the development of better performing biomaterial-based antimicrobial strategies, which are useful to prevent infections.\n",

The concern of patient safety becomes even more critical in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> settings where robots interact with humans. In this paper, we propose a novel risk-aware planning framework to minimize the risk of patient falls by providing a patient with an assistive device. Our approach combines learning-based prediction with model-based control to plan for the fall prevention tasks. This provides advantages compared to end-to-end learning methods in which the robot's performance is limited to specific scenarios, or purely model-based approaches that use relatively simple function approximators and are prone to high modeling errors. We compare two different risk metrics and the combination of them and report the results from various simulated scenarios. The results show that using the proposed cost function, the robot can plan interventions to avoid high fall score events.\n",

In a mixed-design study, healthy participants (N=16, 8 females) completed one of the easy or hard trajectories of the virtual therapy game in standing and seated arrangements using a virtual-reality headset. The results from participants' movement accuracy, task completion time, and usability questionnaires indicate that participants had significant performance differences on two levels of the game based on its difficulty (between-subjects factor), but no difference in seated and standing configurations (within-subjects factor). Also, the hard mode was more favorable among participants.

       "        As a result of the worldwide transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into an unprecedented pandemic. Currently, with unavailable pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines, this novel coronavirus results in a great impact on public health, human society, and global economy, which is likely to last for many years. One of the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that a long-term system with non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing and controlling new infectious diseases is desirable to be implemented. Internet of things (IoT) platform is preferred to be utilized to achieve this goal, due to its ubiquitous sensing ability and seamless connectivity. IoT technology is changing our lives through smart <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span>, smart home, and smart city, which aims to build a more convenient and intelligent community. This paper presents how the IoT could be incorporated into the epidemic prevention and control system. Specifically, we demonstrate a potential fog-cloud combined IoT platform that can be used in the systematic and intelligent COVID-19 prevention and control, which involves five interventions including COVID-19 Symptom Diagnosis, Quarantine Monitoring, Contact Tracing \\&amp; Social Distancing, COVID-19 Outbreak Forecasting, and SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracking. We investigate and review the state-of-the-art literatures of these five interventions to present the capabilities of IoT in countering against the current COVID-19 pandemic or future infectious disease epidemics.\n",

       "        The ReLU activation function (AF) has been extensively applied in deep neural networks, in particular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for image classification despite its unresolved dying ReLU problem, which poses challenges to reliable applications. This issue has obvious important implications for critical applications, such as those in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span>. Recent approaches are just proposing variations of the activation function within the same unresolved dying ReLU challenge. This contribution reports a different research direction by investigating the development of an innovative quantum approach to the ReLU AF that avoids the dying ReLU problem by disruptive design. The Leaky ReLU was leveraged as a baseline on which the two quantum principles of entanglement and superposition were applied to derive the proposed Quantum ReLU (QReLU) and the modified-QReLU (m-QReLU) activation functions. Both QReLU and m-QReLU are implemented and made freely available in TensorFlow and Keras. This original approach is effective and validated extensively in case studies that facilitate the detection of COVID-19 and Parkinson Disease (PD) from medical images. The two novel AFs were evaluated in a two-layered CNN against nine ReLU-based AFs on seven benchmark datasets, including images of spiral drawings taken via graphic tablets from patients with Parkinson Disease and healthy subjects, and point-of-care ultrasound images on the lungs of patients with COVID-19, those with pneumonia and healthy controls. Despite a higher computational cost, results indicated an overall higher classification accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score brought about by either quantum AFs on five of the seven bench-mark datasets, thus demonstrating its potential to be the new benchmark or gold standard AF in CNNs and aid image classification tasks involved in critical applications, such as medical diagnoses of COVID-19 and PD.\n",

To de-bias causal estimators with high-dimensional data in observational studies, recent advances suggest the importance of combining machine learning models for both the propensity score and the outcome function. We propose a novel scalable method to learn double-robust representations for counterfactual predictions, leading to consistent causal estimation if the model for either the propensity score or the outcome, but not necessarily both, is correctly specified. Specifically, we use the entropy balancing method to learn the weights that minimize the Jensen-Shannon divergence of the representation between the treated and control groups, based on which we make robust and efficient counterfactual predictions for both individual and average treatment effects. We provide theoretical justifications for the proposed method. The algorithm shows competitive performance with the state-of-the-art on real world and synthetic data.\n",

       "        Objective: To introduce a method for tracking results and utilization of Artificial Intelligence (tru-AI) in radiology. By tracking both large-scale utilization and AI results data, the tru-AI approach is designed to calculate surrogates for measuring important disease-related observational quantities over time, such as the prevalence of intracranial hemorrhage during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Methods: To quantitatively investigate the clinical applicability of the tru-AI approach, we analyzed service requests for automatically identifying intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on head CT using a commercial AI solution. This software is typically used for AI-based prioritization of radiologists' reading lists for reducing turnaround times in patients with emergent clinical findings, such as ICH or pulmonary embolism.We analyzed data of N=9,421 emergency-setting non-contrast head CT studies at a major US <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> system acquired from November 1, 2019 through June 2, 2020, and compared two observation periods, namely (i) a pre-pandemic epoch from November 1, 2019 through February 29, 2020, and (ii) a period during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, April 1-30, 2020. Results: Although daily CT scan counts were significantly lower during (40.1 +/- 7.9) than before (44.4 +/- 7.6) the COVID-19 outbreak, we found that ICH was more likely to be observed by AI during than before the COVID-19 outbreak (p&lt;0.05), with approximately one daily ICH+ case more than statistically expected. Conclusion: Our results suggest that, by tracking both large-scale utilization and AI results data in radiology, the tru-AI approach can contribute clinical value as a versatile exploratory tool, aiming at a better understanding of pandemic-related effects on <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span>.\n",

       "        COVID-19 was first discovered in December 2019 and has continued to rapidly spread across countries worldwide infecting thousands and millions of people. The virus is deadly, and people who are suffering from prior illnesses or are older than the age of 60 are at a higher risk of mortality. Medicine and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">Healthcare</span> industries have surged towards finding a cure, and different policies have been amended to mitigate the spread of the virus. While Machine Learning (ML) methods have been widely used in other domains, there is now a high demand for ML-aided diagnosis systems for screening, tracking, and predicting the spread of COVID-19 and finding a cure against it. In this paper, we present a journey of what role ML has played so far in combating the virus, mainly looking at it from a screening, forecasting, and vaccine perspectives. We present a comprehensive survey of the ML algorithms and models that can be used on this expedition and aid with battling the virus.\n",

Therefore, MEDEA is conceptually designed as a software suite of four interconnected modules. The main of them is responsible to give direct advice to the crew by means of a deep learning multitask neural network to predict the characters of the medical event, a classifier of the tertiary medical intervention and an optimiser of medical action plans. This module is continuously evaluate and re-trained with changing physiological data from the crew by an adaptive deep learning module, ensuring fairness, interpretability and traceability of decision making during the full operational time of MEDEA. Finally, MEDEA would be semantically interoperable with health information systems on-board by a FHIR module.\n",

Survival models, e.g. the Cox proportional hazards model, can potentially improve this situation by predicting individuals' levels of need, which can then be used to prioritize the waiting lists. Providing care to those in need can prevent institutionalization for those individuals, which both improves quality of life and reduces overall costs. While the benefits of such an approach are clear, care must be taken to ensure that the prioritization process is fair or independent of demographic information-based harmful stereotypes. In this work, we develop multiple fairness definitions for survival models and corresponding fair Cox proportional hazards models to ensure equitable allocation of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> resources. We demonstrate the utility of our methods in terms of fairness and predictive accuracy on two publicly available survival datasets.\n",

Since treatment effects are well-known to vary across groups of patients with different baseline risk, we aimed to extend the OHDSI methods library with a framework for risk-based assessment of treatment effect heterogeneity.\n",
       "  Materials and Methods: The proposed framework consists of five steps: 1) definition of the problem, i.e. the population, the treatment, the comparator and the outcome(s) of interest; 2) identification of relevant databases; 3) development of a prediction model for the outcome(s) of interest; 4) estimation of propensity scores within strata of predicted risk and estimation of relative and absolute treatment effect within strata of predicted risk; 5) evaluation and presentation of results.\n",
       "  Results: We demonstrate our framework by evaluating heterogeneity of the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors versus beta blockers on a set of 9 outcomes of interest across three observational databases. With increasing risk of acute myocardial infarction we observed increasing absolute benefits, i.e. from -0.03% to 0.54% in the lowest to highest risk groups. Cough-related absolute harms decreased from 4.1% to 2.6%.\n",
       "  Conclusions: The proposed framework may be useful for the evaluation of heterogeneity of treatment effect on observational data that are mapped to the OMOP Common Data Model. The proof of concept study demonstrates its feasibility in large observational data. Further insights may arise by application to safety and effectiveness questions across the global data network.\n",

       "        COVID-19 spread across the globe at an immense rate has left <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> systems incapacitated to diagnose and test patients at the needed rate. Studies have shown promising results for detection of COVID-19 from viral bacterial pneumonia in chest X-rays. Automation of COVID-19 testing using medical images can speed up the testing process of patients where health care systems lack sufficient numbers of the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Supervised deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) need enough labeled data for all classes to correctly learn the task of detection. Gathering labeled data is a cumbersome task and requires time and resources which could further strain health care systems and radiologists at the early stages of a pandemic such as COVID-19. In this study, we propose a randomized generative adversarial network (RANDGAN) that detects images of an unknown class (COVID-19) from known and labelled classes (Normal and Viral Pneumonia) without the need for labels and training data from the unknown class of images (COVID-19). We used the largest publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, COVIDx, which is comprised of Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19 images from multiple public databases. In this work, we use transfer learning to segment the lungs in the COVIDx dataset. Next, we show why segmentation of the region of interest (lungs) is vital to correctly learn the task of classification, specifically in datasets that contain images from different resources as it is the case for the COVIDx dataset. Finally, we show improved results in detection of COVID-19 cases using our generative model (RANDGAN) compared to conventional generative adversarial networks (GANs) for anomaly detection in medical images, improving the area under the ROC curve from 0.71 to 0.77.\n",

       "        A biological understanding is key for managing medical conditions, yet psychological and social aspects matter too. The main problem is that these two aspects are hard to quantify and inherently difficult to communicate. To quantify psychological aspects, this work mined around half a million Reddit posts in the sub-communities specialised in 14 medical conditions, and it did so with a new deep-learning framework. In so doing, it was able to associate mentions of medical conditions with those of emotions. To then quantify social aspects, this work designed a probabilistic approach that mines open prescription data from the National Health Service in England to compute the prevalence of drug prescriptions, and to relate such a prevalence to census data. To finally visually communicate each medical condition's biological, psychological, and social aspects through storytelling, we designed a narrative-style layered Martini Glass visualization. In a user study involving 52 participants, after interacting with our visualization, a considerable number of them changed their mind on previously held opinions: 10% gave more importance to the psychological aspects of medical conditions, and 27% were more favourable to the use of social media data in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span>, suggesting the importance of persuasive elements in interactive visualizations.\n",

However, in this digital age, data privacy is a big concern that requires the secure embedding of privacy assurance into the design of all technological solutions that use health data. In this paper, we introduce differential privacy by design (dPbD) framework and discuss its embedding into the federated machine learning system. To limit the scope of our paper, we focus on the problem scenario of COVID-19 imaging data privacy for disease diagnosis by computer vision and deep learning approaches. We discuss the evaluation of the proposed design of federated machine learning systems and discuss how differential privacy by design (dPbD) framework can enhance data privacy in federated learning systems with scalability and robustness. We argue that scalable differentially private federated learning design is a promising solution for building a secure, private and collaborative machine learning model such as required to combat COVID19 challenge.\n",

The advanced wound care market is expected to exceed $22 billion by 2024. Wound care professionals rely heavily on images and image documentation for proper diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately lack of expertise can lead to improper diagnosis of wound etiology and inaccurate wound management and documentation. Fully automatic segmentation of wound areas in natural images is an important part of the diagnosis and care protocol since it is crucial to measure the area of the wound and provide quantitative parameters in the treatment. Various deep learning models have gained success in image analysis including semantic segmentation. Particularly, MobileNetV2 stands out among others due to its lightweight architecture and uncompromised performance. This manuscript proposes a novel convolutional framework based on MobileNetV2 and connected component labelling to segment wound regions from natural images. We build an annotated wound image dataset consisting of 1,109 foot ulcer images from 889 patients to train and test the deep learning models. We demonstrate the effectiveness and mobility of our method by conducting comprehensive experiments and analyses on various segmentation neural networks.\n",

This is impossible to answer using statistical dependence testing alone and requires that we make additional assumptions. We propose several fast and simple criteria for distinguishing cause and effect in pairs of discrete or continuous random variables. The intuition behind them is that predicting the effect variable using the cause variable should be `simpler' than the reverse -- different notions of `simplicity' giving rise to different criteria.

       "        Since the first reports of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019, over 33 million people have been infected worldwide and approximately 1 million people worldwide have died from the disease caused by this virus, COVID-19. In the US alone, there have been approximately 7 million cases and over 200,000 deaths. This outbreak has placed an enormous strain on <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> systems and workers. Severe cases require hospital care, and 8.5\\% of patients require mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). One major challenge is the necessity for clinical care personnel to don and doff cumbersome personal protective equipment (PPE) in order to enter an ICU unit to make simple adjustments to ventilator settings. Although future ventilators and other ICU equipment may be controllable remotely through computer networks, the enormous installed base of existing ventilators do not have this capability. This paper reports the development of a simple, low cost telerobotic system that permits adjustment of ventilator settings from outside the ICU. The system consists of a small Cartesian robot capable of operating a ventilator touch screen with camera vision control via a wirelessly connected tablet master device located outside the room. Engineering system tests demonstrated that the open-loop mechanical repeatability of the device was 7.5\\,mm, and that the average positioning error of the robotic finger under visual servoing control was 5.94\\,mm. Successful usability tests in a simulated ICU environment were carried out and are reported. In addition to enabling a significant reduction in PPE consumption, the prototype system has been shown in a preliminary evaluation to significantly reduce the total time required for a respiratory therapist to perform typical setting adjustments on a commercial ventilator, including donning and doffing PPE, from 271 seconds to 109 seconds.\n",

       "        Conversation has been a primary means for the exchange of information since ancient times. Understanding patterns of information flow in conversations is a critical step in assessing and improving communication quality. In this paper, we describe COnversational DYnamics Model (CODYM) analysis, a novel approach for studying patterns of information flow in conversations. CODYMs are Markov Models that capture sequential dependencies in the lengths of speaker turns. The proposed method is automated and scalable, and preserves the privacy of the conversational participants. The primary function of CODYM analysis is to quantify and visualize patterns of information flow, concisely summarized over sequential turns from one or more conversations. Our approach is general and complements existing methods, providing a new tool for use in the analysis of any type of conversation. As an important first application, we demonstrate the model on transcribed conversations between palliative care clinicians and seriously ill patients. These conversations are dynamic and complex, taking place amidst heavy emotions, and include difficult topics such as end-of-life preferences and patient values. We perform a versatile set of CODYM analyses that (a) establish the validity of the model by confirming known patterns of conversational turn-taking and word usage, (b) identify normative patterns of information flow in serious illness conversations, and (c) show how these patterns vary across narrative time and differ under expressions of anger, fear and sadness. Potential applications of CODYMs range from assessment and training of effective <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> communication to comparing conversational dynamics across language and culture, with the prospect of identifying universal similarities and unique \"fingerprints\" of information flow.\n",

       "        The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency of international concern affecting more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. As of September 30, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 33 million confirmed infections and more than 1 million reported deaths worldwide. Several statistical, machine learning, and hybrid models have previously tried to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases for profoundly affected countries. Due to extreme uncertainty and nonstationarity in the time series data, forecasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases has become a very challenging job. For univariate time series forecasting, there are various statistical and machine learning models available in the literature. But, epidemic forecasting has a dubious track record. Its failures became more prominent due to insufficient data input, flaws in modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, inadequate past evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors, lack of determinacy, and lack of expertise in crucial disciplines. This chapter focuses on assessing different short-term forecasting models that can forecast the daily COVID-19 cases for various countries. In the form of an empirical study on forecasting accuracy, this chapter provides evidence to show that there is no universal method available that can accurately forecast pandemic data. Still, forecasters' predictions are useful for the effective allocation of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers.\n",

While robots have previously been trialled for this task, with promising initial results, the systems have tended to be teleoperated, limiting their flexibility and robustness. This project will use epistemic planning techniques as a core component for action selection in the robot system, in order to generate plans that include physical, sensory, and social actions for interacting with humans. The robot will operate in a task environment where appropriate and safe interaction with children, parents/caregivers, and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> professionals is required.

However, current cutting-edge communication technologies are not able to strictly meet the requirements of these applications, especially in the case of life-threatening events. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a new architecture to support indoor <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> monitoring, with a focus on epileptic patients. Several novel elements are introduced. The first element is the cascading of a WLAN and a cellular network, where IEEE 802.11ax is used for the wireless local area network to collect physiological and environmental data in-home and 5G-enabled Fixed Wireless Access links transfer them to a remote hospital. The second element is the extension of the network slicing concept to the WLAN, and the introduction of two new slice types to support both regular monitoring and emergency handling. Moreover, the inclusion of local computing capabilities at the WLAN router, together with a mobile edge computing resource, represents a further architectural enhancement. Local computation is required to trigger not only health-related alarms, but also the network slicing change in case of emergency: in fact, proper radio resource scheduling is necessary for the cascaded networks to handle <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> traffic together with other promiscuous everyday communication services. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while highlighting the performance gain achieved with respect to baseline solutions.\n",

However, recent researches show that ML models used in different application domains are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new type of adversarial attacks to exploit the ML classifiers used in a SHS. We consider an adversary who has partial knowledge of data distribution, SHS model, and ML algorithm to perform both targeted and untargeted attacks. Employing these adversarial capabilities, we manipulate medical device readings to alter patient status (disease-affected, normal condition, activities, etc.) in the outcome of the SHS. Our attack utilizes five different adversarial ML algorithms (HopSkipJump, Fast Gradient Method, Crafting Decision Tree, Carlini &amp; Wagner, Zeroth Order Optimization) to perform different malicious activities (e.g., data poisoning, misclassify outputs, etc.) on a SHS. Moreover, based on the training and testing phase capabilities of an adversary, we perform white box and black box attacks on a SHS. We evaluate the performance of our work in different SHS settings and medical devices. Our extensive evaluation shows that our proposed adversarial attack can significantly degrade the performance of a ML-based SHS in detecting diseases and normal activities of the patients correctly, which eventually leads to erroneous treatment.\n",

       "        In many of the least developed and developing countries, a multitude of infants continue to suffer and die from vaccine-preventable diseases and malnutrition. Lamentably, the lack of official identification documentation makes it exceedingly difficult to track which infants have been vaccinated and which infants have received nutritional supplements. Answering these questions could prevent this infant suffering and premature death around the world. To that end, we propose Infant-Prints, an end-to-end, low-cost, infant fingerprint recognition system. Infant-Prints is comprised of our (i) custom built, compact, low-cost (85 USD), high-resolution (1,900 ppi), ergonomic fingerprint reader, and (ii) high-resolution infant fingerprint matcher. To evaluate the efficacy of Infant-Prints, we collected a longitudinal infant fingerprint database captured in 4 different sessions over a 12-month time span (December 2018 to January 2020), from 315 infants at the Saran Ashram Hospital, a charitable hospital in Dayalbagh, Agra, India. Our experimental results demonstrate, for the first time, that Infant-Prints can deliver accurate and reliable recognition (over time) of infants enrolled between the ages of 2-3 months, in time for effective delivery of vaccinations, <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span>, and nutritional supplements (TAR=95.2% @ FAR = 1.0% for infants aged 8-16 weeks at enrollment and authenticated 3 months later).\n",

       "        In smart <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span>, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is considered to be an efficient model in pervasive computation from sensor readings. The Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) in the home or community helps the people in providing independent care and enhanced living quality. However, many AAL models were restricted using many factors that include computational cost and system complexity. Moreover, the HAR concept has more relevance because of its applications. Hence, this paper tempts to implement the HAR system using deep learning with the data collected from smart sensors that are publicly available in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (UCI). The proposed model involves three processes: (1) Data collection, (b) Optimal feature selection, (c) Recognition. The data gathered from the benchmark repository is initially subjected to optimal feature selection that helps to select the most significant features. The proposed optimal feature selection is based on a new meta-heuristic algorithm called Colliding Bodies Optimization (CBO). An objective function derived by the recognition accuracy is used for accomplishing the optimal feature selection. Here, the deep learning model called Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used for activity recognition. The proposed model on the concerned benchmark dataset outperforms existing learning methods, providing high performance compared to the conventional models.\n",

This closer-to-optimal allocation can lead to better health outcomes, including the control of the disease spread, and for more people. Producing reliable estimates at smaller geographical levels can be challenging and careful consideration of the nature of the data and the epidemiologic rational is needed. In this paper, we use the DHS data phase V to estimate HIV prevalence at the first-subnational level in Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. We fit the data to a spatial random effect intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) model to smooth the outcome. We also use a sampling specification from a multistage cluster design. We found that Nyanza (P=14.2%) and Nairobi (P=7.8%) in Kenya, Iringa (P=16.2%) and Dar es Salaam (P=10.1%) in Tanzania, and Gaza (P=13.7%) and Maputo City (P=12.7%) in Mozambique are the regions with the highest prevalence of HIV, within country.

In this work, we learn sequence classifiers that favour early classification from an evolving observation trace. While many state-of-the-art sequence classifiers are neural networks, and in particular LSTMs, our classifiers take the form of finite state automata and are learned via discrete optimization. Our automata-based classifiers are interpretable---supporting explanation, counterfactual reasoning, and human-in-the-loop modification---and have strong empirical performance. Experiments over a suite of goal recognition and behaviour classification datasets show our learned automata-based classifiers to have comparable test performance to LSTM-based classifiers, with the added advantage of being interpretable.\n",

       "        The Affordable care Act of 2010 had introduced Readmission reduction program in 2012 to reduce avoidable re-admissions to control rising <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> costs. Wound care impacts 15 of medicare beneficiaries making it one of the major contributors of medicare health care cost. Health plans have been exploring proactive health care services that can focus on preventing wound recurrences and re-admissions to control the wound care costs. With rising costs of Wound care industry, it has become of paramount importance to reduce wound recurrences &amp; patient re-admissions. What factors are responsible for a Wound to recur which ultimately lead to hospitalization or re-admission? Is there a way to identify the patients at risk of re-admission before the occurrence using data driven analysis? Patient re-admission risk management has become critical for patients suffering from chronic wounds such as diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, and vascular ulcers. Understanding the risk &amp; the factors that cause patient readmission can help care providers and patients avoid wound recurrences. Our work focuses on identifying patients who are at high risk of re-admission &amp; determining the time period with in which a patient might get re-admitted. Frequent re-admissions add financial stress to the patient &amp; Health plan and deteriorate the quality of life of the patient. Having this information can allow a provider to set up preventive measures that can delay, if not prevent, patients' re-admission. On a combined wound &amp; episode-level data set of patient's wound care information, our extended autoprognosis achieves a recall of 92 and a precision of 92 for the predicting a patient's re-admission risk. For new patient class, precision and recall are as high as 91 and 98, respectively. We are also able to predict the patient's discharge event for a re-admission event to occur through our model with a MAE of 2.3 weeks.\n",

Lung disease remains a major <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> challenge with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The predominant lung disease was lung cancer. Until recently, the world has witnessed the global pandemic of COVID19, the Novel coronavirus outbreak. We have experienced how viral infection of lung and heart claimed thousands of lives worldwide. With the unprecedented advancement of Artificial Intelligence in recent years, Machine learning can be used to easily detect and classify medical imagery. It is much faster and most of the time more accurate than human radiologists. Once implemented, it is more cost-effective and time-saving. In our study, we evaluated the efficacy of Microsoft Cognitive Service to detect and classify COVID19 induced pneumonia from other Viral/Bacterial pneumonia based on X-Ray and CT images. We wanted to assess the implication and accuracy of the Automated ML-based Rapid Application Development (RAD) environment in the field of Medical Image diagnosis. This study will better equip us to respond with an ML-based diagnostic Decision Support System(DSS) for a Pandemic situation like COVID19. After optimization, the trained network achieved 96.8% Average Precision which was implemented as a Web Application for consumption. However, the same trained network did not perform the same like Web Application when ported to Smartphone for Real-time inference. Which was our main interest of study. The authors believe, there is scope for further study on this issue. One of the main goal of this study was to develop and evaluate the performance of AI-powered Smartphone-based Real-time Application.

       "        Automatic structuring of electronic medical records is of high demand for clinical workflow solutions to facilitate extraction, storage, and querying of patient care information. However, developing a scalable solution is extremely challenging, specifically for radiology reports, as most <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> institutes use either no template or department/institute specific templates. Moreover, radiologists' reporting style varies from one to another as sentences are telegraphic and do not follow general English grammar rules. We present an ensemble method that consolidates the predictions of three models, capturing various attributes of textual information for automatic labeling of sentences with section labels. These three models are: 1) Focus Sentence model, capturing context of the target sentence; 2) Surrounding Context model, capturing the neighboring context of the target sentence; and finally, 3) Formatting/Layout model, aimed at learning report formatting cues. We utilize Bi-directional LSTMs, followed by sentence encoders, to acquire the context. Furthermore, we define several features that incorporate the structure of reports. We compare our proposed approach against multiple baselines and state-of-the-art approaches on a proprietary dataset as well as 100 manually annotated radiology notes from the MIMIC-III dataset, which we are making publicly available. Our proposed approach significantly outperforms other approaches by achieving 97.1% accuracy.\n",

       "        Efficient design of biological sequences will have a great impact across many industrial and <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span> domains. However, discovering improved sequences requires solving a difficult optimization problem. Traditionally, this challenge was approached by biologists through a model-free method known as \"directed evolution\", the iterative process of random mutation and selection. As the ability to build models that capture the sequence-to-function map improves, such models can be used as oracles to screen sequences before running experiments. In recent years, interest in better algorithms that effectively use such oracles to outperform model-free approaches has intensified. These span from approaches based on Bayesian Optimization, to regularized generative models and adaptations of reinforcement learning. In this work, we implement an open-source Fitness Landscape EXploration Sandbox (FLEXS: github.com/samsinai/FLEXS) environment to test and evaluate these algorithms based on their optimality, consistency, and robustness. Using FLEXS, we develop an easy-to-implement, scalable, and robust evolutionary greedy algorithm (AdaLead). Despite its simplicity, we show that AdaLead is a remarkably strong benchmark that out-competes more complex state of the art approaches in a variety of biologically motivated sequence design challenges.\n",

       "        Deep neural networks are becoming more and more popular due to their revolutionary success in diverse areas, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, the decision-making processes of these models are generally not interpretable to users. In various domains, such as <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span>, finance, or law, it is critical to know the reasons behind a decision made by an artificial intelligence system. Therefore, several directions for explaining neural models have recently been explored.\n",
       "  In this thesis, I investigate two major directions for explaining deep neural networks. The first direction consists of feature-based post-hoc explanatory methods, that is, methods that aim to explain an already trained and fixed model (post-hoc), and that provide explanations in terms of input features, such as tokens for text and superpixels for images (feature-based). The second direction consists of self-explanatory neural models that generate natural language explanations, that is, models that have a built-in module that generates explanations for the predictions of the model.\n",

Explanations have often added to an AI system in a non-principled, post-hoc manner. With greater adoption of these systems and emphasis on user-centric explainability, there is a need for a structured representation that treats explainability as a primary consideration, mapping end user needs to specific explanation types and the system's AI capabilities. We design an explanation ontology to model both the role of explanations, accounting for the system and user attributes in the process, and the range of different literature-derived explanation types. We indicate how the ontology can support user requirements for explanations in the domain of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">healthcare</span>. We evaluate our ontology with a set of competency questions geared towards a system designer who might use our ontology to decide which explanation types to include, given a combination of users' needs and a system's capabilities, both in system design settings and in real-time operations. Through the use of this ontology, system designers will be able to make informed choices on which explanations AI systems can and should provide.\n",

      "        Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used reliable, non-invasive approach for cardiovascular disease diagnosis. With the rapid growth of ECG examinations and the insufficiency of cardiologists, accurate and automatic diagnosis of ECG signals has become a hot research topic. Deep learning methods have demonstrated promising results in predictive healthcare tasks. In this paper, we developed a deep neural network for multi-label classification of cardiac arrhythmias in 12-lead ECG recordings. Experiments on a public 12-lead ECG dataset showed the effectiveness of our method. The proposed model achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.970 and an average F1 score of 0.813. The deep model showed superior performance than 4 machine learning methods learned from extracted expert features. Besides, the deep models trained on single-lead ECGs produce lower performance than using all 12 leads simultaneously. The best-performing leads are lead I, aVR, and V5 among 12 leads. Finally, we employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the model's behavior at both patient level and population level.

      "        Health data is a sensitive category of personal data. It might result in a high risk to individual and health information handling rights and opportunities unless there is a palatable defense. Reasonable security standards are needed to protect electronic health records (EHR). All personal data handling needs adequate explanation. Maintaining access to medical data even in the developing world would favor health and well-being across the world. Unfortunately, there are still countries that hinder the portability of medical records. Numerous occurrences have shown that it still takes weeks for the medical data to be ported from one general physician (GP) to another. Cross border portability is nearly impossible due to the lack of technical infrastructure and standardization. We demonstrate the difficulty of the portability of medical records with some example case studies as a collaborative engagement exercise through a data mapping process to describe how different people and datapoints interact and evaluate EHR portability techniques. We then propose a blockchain-based EHR system that allows secure, and cross border sharing of medical data. The ethical and technical challenges around having such a system have also been discussed in this study.\n",

      "        Close to half of the world population have smartphones, while a typical flagship smartphone today has been integrated with more than 20 smart components and sensors, making a smartphone a highly integrated platform that can potentially mimic the five senses of humans. Recent advancement in achieving high compactness, high performance computing, high flexibility, and multiplexed functionality in smartphones have enabled them for many cutting-edge healthcare applications, such as single-molecule imaging, medical diagnosis, and biosensing, which were conventionally done with bulky and sophisticated devices. Most of the current healthcare applications are developed based on using the photon-sensitive components, such as CMOS sensors, flash & fill lights, lens modules, and LED lights in the screen, leaving the rest of the smart and high-performance sensors rarely explored. In this Perspective, we review recent progresses in advanced sensors in modern smartphones and discuss how those sensors have great, as yet unmet, promise to offer widespread and easy-to-implement solutions to many emerging healthcare applications, including nanoscale sensing, point-of-care testing, pollution monitoring, etc.\n",

      "        Modeling infection spread during pandemics is not new, with models using past data to tune simulation parameters for predictions. These help understand the healthcare burden posed by a pandemic and respond accordingly. However, the problem of how college/university campuses should function during a pandemic is new for the following reasons:(i) social contact in colleges are structured and can be engineered for chosen objectives, (ii) the last pandemic to cause such societal disruption was over 100 years ago, when higher education was not a critical part of society, (ii) not much was known about causes of pandemics, and hence effective ways of safe operations were not known, and (iii) today with distance learning, remote operation of an academic institution is possible. Our approach is unique in presenting a flexible simulation system, containing a suite of model libraries, one for each major component. The system integrates agent based modeling (ABM) and stochastic network approach, and models the interactions among individual entities, e.g., students, instructors, classrooms, residences, etc. in great detail. For each decision to be made, the system can be used to predict the impact of various choices, and thus enable the administrator to make informed decisions. While current approaches are good for infection modeling, they lack accuracy in social contact modeling. Our ABM approach, combined with ideas from Network Science, presents a novel approach to contact modeling. A detailed case study of the University of Minnesota's Sunrise Plan is presented. For each decisions made, its impact was assessed, and results used to get a measure of confidence. We believe this flexible tool can be a valuable asset for various kinds of organizations to assess their infection risks in pandemic-time operations, including middle and high schools, factories, warehouses, and small/medium sized businesses.\n",

      "        The recent coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the many challenges faced by the healthcare, public safety, and economic systems when confronted with a surge in patients that require intensive treatment and a population that must be quarantined or shelter in place. The most obvious and pressing challenge is taking care of acutely ill patients while managing spread of infection within the care facility, but this is just the tip of the iceberg if we consider what could be done to prepare in advance for future pandemics. Beyond the obvious need for strengthening medical knowledge and preparedness, there is a complementary need to anticipate and address the engineering challenges associated with infectious disease emergencies. Robotic technologies are inherently programmable, and robotic systems have been adapted and deployed, to some extent, in the current crisis for such purposes as transport, logistics, and disinfection. As technical capabilities advance and as the installed base of robotic systems increases in the future, they could play a much more significant role in future crises. This report is the outcome of a virtual workshop co-hosted by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held on July 9-10, 2020. The workshop consisted of over forty participants including representatives from the engineering/robotics community, clinicians, critical care workers, public health and safety experts, and emergency responders. It identifies key challenges faced by healthcare responders and the general population and then identifies robotic/technological responses to these challenges. Then it identifies the key research/knowledge barriers that need to be addressed in developing effective, scalable solutions. Finally, the report ends with the following recommendations on how to implement this strategy.\n",

      "        Acute and chronic wounds are a challenge to healthcare systems around the world and affect many people's lives annually. Wound classification is a key step in wound diagnosis that would help clinicians to identify an optimal treatment procedure. Hence, having a high-performance classifier assists the specialists in the field to classify the wounds with less financial and time costs. Different machine learning and deep learning-based wound classification methods have been proposed in the literature. In this study, we have developed an ensemble Deep Convolutional Neural Network-based classifier to classify wound images including surgical, diabetic, and venous ulcers, into multi-classes. The output classification scores of two classifiers (patch-wise and image-wise) are fed into a Multi-Layer Perceptron to provide a superior classification performance. A 5-fold cross-validation approach is used to evaluate the proposed method. We obtained maximum and average classification accuracy values of 96.4% and 94.28% for binary and 91.9\\% and 87.7\\% for 3-class classification problems. The results show that our proposed method can be used effectively as a decision support system in classification of wound images or other related clinical applications.\n",

      "        Privacy protection in electronic healthcare applications is an important consideration due to the sensitive nature of personal health data. Internet of Health Things (IoHT) networks have privacy requirements within a healthcare setting. However, these networks have unique challenges and security requirements (integrity, authentication, privacy and availability) must also be balanced with the need to maintain efficiency in order to conserve battery power, which can be a significant limitation in IoHT devices and networks. Data are usually transferred without undergoing filtering or optimization, and this traffic can overload sensors and cause rapid battery consumption when interacting with IoHT networks. This consequently poses restrictions on the practical implementation of these devices. As a solution to address the issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving two-tier data inference framework, this can conserve battery consumption by reducing the data size required to transmit through inferring the sensed data and can also protect the sensitive data from leakage to adversaries. Results from experimental evaluations on privacy show the validity of the proposed scheme as well as significant data savings without compromising the accuracy of the data transmission, which contributes to energy efficiency of IoHT sensor devices.\n",

      "        Question Answering (QA) on Electronic Health Records (EHR), namely EHR QA, can work as a crucial milestone towards developing an intelligent agent in healthcare. EHR data are typically stored in a relational database, which can also be converted to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), allowing two approaches for EHR QA: Table-based QA and Knowledge Graph-based QA. We hypothesize that the graph-based approach is more suitable for EHR QA as graphs can represent relations between entities and values more naturally compared to tables, which essentially require JOIN operations. To validate our hypothesis, we first construct EHR QA datasets based on MIMIC-III, where the same question-answer pairs are represented in SQL (table-based) and SPARQL (graph-based), respectively. We then test a state-of-the-art EHR QA model on both datasets where the model demonstrated superior QA performance on the SPARQL version. Finally, we open-source both MIMICSQL* and MIMIC-SPARQL* to encourage further EHR QA research in both direction\n",

Medical devices and their connectivity through Internet with alongwith the electronics health record (EHR) and AI analytics making H-CPS possible. IoMT-end devices like wearables and implantables are key for H-CPS based smart healthcare. Smart garment is a specific wearable which can be used for smart healthcare. There are various smart garments that help users to monitor their body vitals in real-time. Many commercially available garments collect the vital data and transmit it to the mobile application for visualization. However, these don't perform real-time analysis for the user to comprehend their health conditions. Also, such garments are not included with an alert system to alert users and contacts in case of emergency. In MyWear, we propose a wearable body vital monitoring garment that captures physiological data and automatically analyses such heart rate, stress level, muscle activity to detect abnormalities. A copy of the physiological data is transmitted to the cloud for detecting any abnormalities in heart beats and predict any potential heart failure in future. We also propose a deep neural network (DNN) model that automatically classifies abnormal heart beat and potential heart failure. For immediate assistance in such a situation, we propose an alert system that sends an alert message to nearby medical officials. The proposed MyWear has an average accuracy of 96.9% and precision of 97.3% for detection of the abnormalities.\n",

In this work we are investigating ways to analyze the data available through EDGAR database. This may serve portfolio managers (pension funds, mutual funds, insurance, hedge funds) to get automated insights into companies they invest in, to better manage their portfolios. The analysis is based on Artificial Neural Networks applied to the data.} In particular, one of the most popular machine learning methods, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, originally developed to interpret and classify images, is now being used to interpret financial data. This work investigates the best way to input data collected from the SEC filings into a CNN architecture. We incorporate accounting principles and mathematical methods into the design of three image encoding methods. Specifically, two methods are derived from accounting principles (Sequential Arrangement, Category Chunk Arrangement) and one is using a purely mathematical technique (Hilbert Vector Arrangement). In this work we analyze fundamental financial data as well as financial ratio data and study companies from the financial, healthcare and IT sectors in the United States. We find that using imaging techniques to input data for CNN works better for financial ratio data but is not significantly better than simply using the 1D input directly for fundamental data. We do not find the Hilbert Vector Arrangement technique to be significantly better than other imaging techniques.\n",

The DL models utilizing massive computing power and enormous datasets have significantly outperformed prior historical benchmarks on increasingly difficult, well-defined research tasks across technology domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, signal processing, and human-computer interactions. However, the Black-Box nature of DL models and their over-reliance on massive amounts of data condensed into labels and dense representations poses challenges for interpretability and explainability of the system. Furthermore, DLs have not yet been proven in their ability to effectively utilize relevant domain knowledge and experience critical to human understanding. This aspect is missing in early data-focused approaches and necessitated knowledge-infused learning and other strategies to incorporate computational knowledge. This article demonstrates how knowledge, provided as a knowledge graph, is incorporated into DL methods using knowledge-infused learning, which is one of the strategies. We then discuss how this makes a fundamental difference in the interpretability and explainability of current approaches, and illustrate it with examples from natural language processing for healthcare and education applications.\n",

SUMO further generates an extractive summary by presenting a diversified set of sentences from the documents that explain its decision on the correctness of the textual claim. Prior approaches to address the problem of fact checking and evidence extraction have relied on simple concatenation of claim and document word embeddings as an input to claim driven attention weight computation. This is done so as to extract salient words and sentences from the documents that help establish the correctness of the claim. However, this design of claim-driven attention does not capture the contextual information in documents properly. We improve on the prior art by using improved claim and title guided hierarchical attention to model effective contextual cues.

      "        Bacterial colonization ofimplanted biomedical devicesis themain cause of healthcare-associated infections, estimated to be 8.8 million per year in Europe. Many infections originate from damaged skin, which lets microorganisms exploit injuries and surgical accesses as passageways to reach the implant site and inner organs. Therefore, an effective treatment of skin damage is highly desirable for the success of many biomaterial-related surgical procedures. Due to gained resistance to antibiotics, new antibacterial treatments are becoming vital to control nosocomial infections arising as surgical and post-surgical complications. Surface coatings can avoid biofouling and bacterial colonization thanks to biomaterial inherent properties (e.g., super hydrophobicity), specifically without using drugs, which may cause bacterial resistance. The focus of this review is to highlight the emerging role of degradable polymeric micro- and nano-structures that show intrinsic antifouling and antimicrobial properties, with a special outlook towards biomedical applications dealing with skin and skin damage. The intrinsic properties owned by the biomaterials encompass three main categories: (1) physical-mechanical, (2) chemical, and (3) electrostatic. Clinical relevance in ear prostheses and breast implants is reported. Collecting and discussing the updated outcomes in this field would help the development of better performing biomaterial-based antimicrobial strategies, which are useful to prevent infections.\n",

The concern of patient safety becomes even more critical in healthcare settings where robots interact with humans. In this paper, we propose a novel risk-aware planning framework to minimize the risk of patient falls by providing a patient with an assistive device. Our approach combines learning-based prediction with model-based control to plan for the fall prevention tasks. This provides advantages compared to end-to-end learning methods in which the robot's performance is limited to specific scenarios, or purely model-based approaches that use relatively simple function approximators and are prone to high modeling errors. We compare two different risk metrics and the combination of them and report the results from various simulated scenarios. The results show that using the proposed cost function, the robot can plan interventions to avoid high fall score events.\n",

Currently, with unavailable pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines, this novel coronavirus results in a great impact on public health, human society, and global economy, which is likely to last for many years. One of the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that a long-term system with non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing and controlling new infectious diseases is desirable to be implemented. Internet of things (IoT) platform is preferred to be utilized to achieve this goal, due to its ubiquitous sensing ability and seamless connectivity. IoT technology is changing our lives through smart healthcare, smart home, and smart city, which aims to build a more convenient and intelligent community. This paper presents how the IoT could be incorporated into the epidemic prevention and control system. Specifically, we demonstrate a potential fog-cloud combined IoT platform that can be used in the systematic and intelligent COVID-19 prevention and control, which involves five interventions including COVID-19 Symptom Diagnosis, Quarantine Monitoring, Contact Tracing \\& Social Distancing, COVID-19 Outbreak Forecasting, and SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracking.

      "        The ReLU activation function (AF) has been extensively applied in deep neural networks, in particular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for image classification despite its unresolved dying ReLU problem, which poses challenges to reliable applications. This issue has obvious important implications for critical applications, such as those in healthcare. Recent approaches are just proposing variations of the activation function within the same unresolved dying ReLU challenge. This contribution reports a different research direction by investigating the development of an innovative quantum approach to the ReLU AF that avoids the dying ReLU problem by disruptive design. The Leaky ReLU was leveraged as a baseline on which the two quantum principles of entanglement and superposition were applied to derive the proposed Quantum ReLU (QReLU) and the modified-QReLU (m-QReLU) activation functions. Both QReLU and m-QReLU are implemented and made freely available in TensorFlow and Keras. This original approach is effective and validated extensively in case studies that facilitate the detection of COVID-19 and Parkinson Disease (PD) from medical images. The two novel AFs were evaluated in a two-layered CNN against nine ReLU-based AFs on seven benchmark datasets, including images of spiral drawings taken via graphic tablets from patients with Parkinson Disease and healthy subjects, and point-of-care ultrasound images on the lungs of patients with COVID-19, those with pneumonia and healthy controls. Despite a higher computational cost, results indicated an overall higher classification accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score brought about by either quantum AFs on five of the seven bench-mark datasets, thus demonstrating its potential to be the new benchmark or gold standard AF in CNNs and aid image classification tasks involved in critical applications, such as medical diagnoses of COVID-19 and PD.\n",

We propose a novel scalable method to learn double-robust representations for counterfactual predictions, leading to consistent causal estimation if the model for either the propensity score or the outcome, but not necessarily both, is correctly specified. Specifically, we use the entropy balancing method to learn the weights that minimize the Jensen-Shannon divergence of the representation between the treated and control groups, based on which we make robust and efficient counterfactual predictions for both individual and average treatment effects. We provide theoretical justifications for the proposed method. The algorithm shows competitive performance with the state-of-the-art on real world and synthetic data.\n",

      "        Objective: To introduce a method for tracking results and utilization of Artificial Intelligence (tru-AI) in radiology. By tracking both large-scale utilization and AI results data, the tru-AI approach is designed to calculate surrogates for measuring important disease-related observational quantities over time, such as the prevalence of intracranial hemorrhage during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Methods: To quantitatively investigate the clinical applicability of the tru-AI approach, we analyzed service requests for automatically identifying intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on head CT using a commercial AI solution. This software is typically used for AI-based prioritization of radiologists' reading lists for reducing turnaround times in patients with emergent clinical findings, such as ICH or pulmonary embolism.We analyzed data of N=9,421 emergency-setting non-contrast head CT studies at a major US healthcare system acquired from November 1, 2019 through June 2, 2020, and compared two observation periods, namely (i) a pre-pandemic epoch from November 1, 2019 through February 29, 2020, and (ii) a period during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, April 1-30, 2020. Results: Although daily CT scan counts were significantly lower during (40.1 +/- 7.9) than before (44.4 +/- 7.6) the COVID-19 outbreak, we found that ICH was more likely to be observed by AI during than before the COVID-19 outbreak (p<0.05), with approximately one daily ICH+ case more than statistically expected. Conclusion: Our results suggest that, by tracking both large-scale utilization and AI results data in radiology, the tru-AI approach can contribute clinical value as a versatile exploratory tool, aiming at a better understanding of pandemic-related effects on healthcare.\n",

The virus is deadly, and people who are suffering from prior illnesses or are older than the age of 60 are at a higher risk of mortality. Medicine and Healthcare industries have surged towards finding a cure, and different policies have been amended to mitigate the spread of the virus. While Machine Learning (ML) methods have been widely used in other domains, there is now a high demand for ML-aided diagnosis systems for screening, tracking, and predicting the spread of COVID-19 and finding a cure against it.

This module is continuously evaluate and re-trained with changing physiological data from the crew by an adaptive deep learning module, ensuring fairness, interpretability and traceability of decision making during the full operational time of MEDEA. Finally, MEDEA would be semantically interoperable with health information systems on-board by a FHIR module.\n",

      "Healthcare programs such as Medicaid provide crucial services to vulnerable populations, but due to limited resources, many of the individuals who need these services the most languish on waiting lists. Survival models, e.g. the Cox proportional hazards model, can potentially improve this situation by predicting individuals' levels of need, which can then be used to prioritize the waiting lists. Providing care to those in need can prevent institutionalization for those individuals, which both improves quality of life and reduces overall costs. While the benefits of such an approach are clear, care must be taken to ensure that the prioritization process is fair or independent of demographic information-based harmful stereotypes. In this work, we develop multiple fairness definitions for survival models and corresponding fair Cox proportional hazards models to ensure equitable allocation of healthcare resources.

      "        COVID-19 spread across the globe at an immense rate has left healthcare systems incapacitated to diagnose and test patients at the needed rate. Studies have shown promising results for detection of COVID-19 from viral bacterial pneumonia in chest X-rays. Automation of COVID-19 testing using medical images can speed up the testing process of patients where health care systems lack sufficient numbers of the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Supervised deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) need enough labeled data for all classes to correctly learn the task of detection. Gathering labeled data is a cumbersome task and requires time and resources which could further strain health care systems and radiologists at the early stages of a pandemic such as COVID-19. In this study, we propose a randomized generative adversarial network (RANDGAN) that detects images of an unknown class (COVID-19) from known and labelled classes (Normal and Viral Pneumonia) without the need for labels and training data from the unknown class of images (COVID-19). We used the largest publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, COVIDx, which is comprised of Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19 images from multiple public databases. In this work, we use transfer learning to segment the lungs in the COVIDx dataset. Next, we show why segmentation of the region of interest (lungs) is vital to correctly learn the task of classification, specifically in datasets that contain images from different resources as it is the case for the COVIDx dataset. Finally, we show improved results in detection of COVID-19 cases using our generative model (RANDGAN) compared to conventional generative adversarial networks (GANs) for anomaly detection in medical images, improving the area under the ROC curve from 0.71 to 0.77.\n",

      "        A biological understanding is key for managing medical conditions, yet psychological and social aspects matter too. The main problem is that these two aspects are hard to quantify and inherently difficult to communicate. To quantify psychological aspects, this work mined around half a million Reddit posts in the sub-communities specialised in 14 medical conditions, and it did so with a new deep-learning framework. In so doing, it was able to associate mentions of medical conditions with those of emotions. To then quantify social aspects, this work designed a probabilistic approach that mines open prescription data from the National Health Service in England to compute the prevalence of drug prescriptions, and to relate such a prevalence to census data. To finally visually communicate each medical condition's biological, psychological, and social aspects through storytelling, we designed a narrative-style layered Martini Glass visualization. In a user study involving 52 participants, after interacting with our visualization, a considerable number of them changed their mind on previously held opinions: 10% gave more importance to the psychological aspects of medical conditions, and 27% were more favourable to the use of social media data in healthcare, suggesting the importance of persuasive elements in interactive visualizations.\n",

The advanced wound care market is expected to exceed $22 billion by 2024. Wound care professionals rely heavily on images and image documentation for proper diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately lack of expertise can lead to improper diagnosis of wound etiology and inaccurate wound management and documentation. Fully automatic segmentation of wound areas in natural images is an important part of the diagnosis and care protocol since it is crucial to measure the area of the wound and provide quantitative parameters in the treatment. Various deep learning models have gained success in image analysis including semantic segmentation. Particularly, MobileNetV2 stands out among others due to its lightweight architecture and uncompromised performance. This manuscript proposes a novel convolutional framework based on MobileNetV2 and connected component labelling to segment wound regions from natural images. We build an annotated wound image dataset consisting of 1,109 foot ulcer images from 889 patients to train and test the deep learning models. We demonstrate the effectiveness and mobility of our method by conducting comprehensive experiments and analyses on various segmentation neural networks.\n",

      "        Since the first reports of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019, over 33 million people have been infected worldwide and approximately 1 million people worldwide have died from the disease caused by this virus, COVID-19. In the US alone, there have been approximately 7 million cases and over 200,000 deaths. This outbreak has placed an enormous strain on healthcare systems and workers. Severe cases require hospital care, and 8.5\\% of patients require mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). One major challenge is the necessity for clinical care personnel to don and doff cumbersome personal protective equipment (PPE) in order to enter an ICU unit to make simple adjustments to ventilator settings. Although future ventilators and other ICU equipment may be controllable remotely through computer networks, the enormous installed base of existing ventilators do not have this capability. This paper reports the development of a simple, low cost telerobotic system that permits adjustment of ventilator settings from outside the ICU. The system consists of a small Cartesian robot capable of operating a ventilator touch screen with camera vision control via a wirelessly connected tablet master device located outside the room. Engineering system tests demonstrated that the open-loop mechanical repeatability of the device was 7.5\\,mm, and that the average positioning error of the robotic finger under visual servoing control was 5.94\\,mm. Successful usability tests in a simulated ICU environment were carried out and are reported. In addition to enabling a significant reduction in PPE consumption, the prototype system has been shown in a preliminary evaluation to significantly reduce the total time required for a respiratory therapist to perform typical setting adjustments on a commercial ventilator, including donning and doffing PPE, from 271 seconds to 109 seconds.\n",

Understanding patterns of information flow in conversations is a critical step in assessing and improving communication quality. In this paper, we describe COnversational DYnamics Model (CODYM) analysis, a novel approach for studying patterns of information flow in conversations. CODYMs are Markov Models that capture sequential dependencies in the lengths of speaker turns. The proposed method is automated and scalable, and preserves the privacy of the conversational participants. The primary function of CODYM analysis is to quantify and visualize patterns of information flow, concisely summarized over sequential turns from one or more conversations. Our approach is general and complements existing methods, providing a new tool for use in the analysis of any type of conversation. As an important first application, we demonstrate the model on transcribed conversations between palliative care clinicians and seriously ill patients. These conversations are dynamic and complex, taking place amidst heavy emotions, and include difficult topics such as end-of-life preferences and patient values. We perform a versatile set of CODYM analyses that (a) establish the validity of the model by confirming known patterns of conversational turn-taking and word usage, (b) identify normative patterns of information flow in serious illness conversations, and (c) show how these patterns vary across narrative time and differ under expressions of anger, fear and sadness. Potential applications of CODYMs range from assessment and training of effective healthcare communication to comparing conversational dynamics across language and culture, with the prospect of identifying universal similarities and unique \"fingerprints\" of information flow.\n",

As of September 30, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 33 million confirmed infections and more than 1 million reported deaths worldwide. Several statistical, machine learning, and hybrid models have previously tried to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases for profoundly affected countries. Due to extreme uncertainty and nonstationarity in the time series data, forecasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases has become a very challenging job. For univariate time series forecasting, there are various statistical and machine learning models available in the literature. But, epidemic forecasting has a dubious track record. Its failures became more prominent due to insufficient data input, flaws in modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, inadequate past evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors, lack of determinacy, and lack of expertise in crucial disciplines. This chapter focuses on assessing different short-term forecasting models that can forecast the daily COVID-19 cases for various countries. In the form of an empirical study on forecasting accuracy, this chapter provides evidence to show that there is no universal method available that can accurately forecast pandemic data. Still, forecasters' predictions are useful for the effective allocation of healthcare resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers.\n",

However, current cutting-edge communication technologies are not able to strictly meet the requirements of these applications, especially in the case of life-threatening events. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a new architecture to support indoor healthcare monitoring, with a focus on epileptic patients. Several novel elements are introduced. The first element is the cascading of a WLAN and a cellular network, where IEEE 802.11ax is used for the wireless local area network to collect physiological and environmental data in-home and 5G-enabled Fixed Wireless Access links transfer them to a remote hospital. The second element is the extension of the network slicing concept to the WLAN, and the introduction of two new slice types to support both regular monitoring and emergency handling. Moreover, the inclusion of local computing capabilities at the WLAN router, together with a mobile edge computing resource, represents a further architectural enhancement. Local computation is required to trigger not only health-related alarms, but also the network slicing change in case of emergency: in fact, proper radio resource scheduling is necessary for the cascaded networks to handle healthcare traffic together with other promiscuous everyday communication services. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while highlighting the performance gain achieved with respect to baseline solutions.\n",

In this context, Machine Learning (ML) models are used to extract valuable features and insights from high-dimensional and heterogeneous healthcare data to detect different diseases and patient activities in a Smart Healthcare System (SHS). However, recent researches show that ML models used in different application domains are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new type of adversarial attacks to exploit the ML classifiers used in a SHS. We consider an adversary who has partial knowledge of data distribution, SHS model, and ML algorithm to perform both targeted and untargeted attacks. Employing these adversarial capabilities, we manipulate medical device readings to alter patient status (disease-affected, normal condition, activities, etc.) in the outcome of the SHS. Our attack utilizes five different adversarial ML algorithms (HopSkipJump, Fast Gradient Method, Crafting Decision Tree, Carlini & Wagner, Zeroth Order Optimization) to perform different malicious activities (e.g., data poisoning, misclassify outputs, etc.) on a SHS. Moreover, based on the training and testing phase capabilities of an adversary, we perform white box and black box attacks on a SHS. We evaluate the performance of our work in different SHS settings and medical devices. Our extensive evaluation shows that our proposed adversarial attack can significantly degrade the performance of a ML-based SHS in detecting diseases and normal activities of the patients correctly, which eventually leads to erroneous treatment.\n",

The Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) in the home or community helps the people in providing independent care and enhanced living quality. However, many AAL models were restricted using many factors that include computational cost and system complexity. Moreover, the HAR concept has more relevance because of its applications. Hence, this paper tempts to implement the HAR system using deep learning with the data collected from smart sensors that are publicly available in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (UCI). The proposed model involves three processes: (1) Data collection, (b) Optimal feature selection, (c) Recognition. The data gathered from the benchmark repository is initially subjected to optimal feature selection that helps to select the most significant features. The proposed optimal feature selection is based on a new meta-heuristic algorithm called Colliding Bodies Optimization (CBO). An objective function derived by the recognition accuracy is used for accomplishing the optimal feature selection. Here, the deep learning model called Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used for activity recognition. The proposed model on the concerned benchmark dataset outperforms existing learning methods, providing high performance compared to the conventional models.\n",

This closer-to-optimal allocation can lead to better health outcomes, including the control of the disease spread, and for more people. Producing reliable estimates at smaller geographical levels can be challenging and careful consideration of the nature of the data and the epidemiologic rational is needed. In this paper, we use the DHS data phase V to estimate HIV prevalence at the first-subnational level in Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. We fit the data to a spatial random effect intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) model to smooth the outcome. We also use a sampling specification from a multistage cluster design. We found that Nyanza (P=14.2%) and Nairobi (P=7.8%) in Kenya, Iringa (P=16.2%) and Dar es Salaam (P=10.1%) in Tanzania, and Gaza (P=13.7%) and Maputo City (P=12.7%) in Mozambique are the regions with the highest prevalence of HIV, within country. Our results are based on statistically rigorous methods that allowed us to obtain an accurate visual representation of the HIV prevalence in the subset of African countries we chose. These results can help in identification and targeting of high-prevalent regions to increase the supply of healthcare services to reduce the spread of the disease and increase the health quality of people living with HIV.\n",

      "        The Affordable care Act of 2010 had introduced Readmission reduction program in 2012 to reduce avoidable re-admissions to control rising healthcare costs. Wound care impacts 15 of medicare beneficiaries making it one of the major contributors of medicare health care cost. Health plans have been exploring proactive health care services that can focus on preventing wound recurrences and re-admissions to control the wound care costs. With rising costs of Wound care industry, it has become of paramount importance to reduce wound recurrences & patient re-admissions. What factors are responsible for a Wound to recur which ultimately lead to hospitalization or re-admission? Is there a way to identify the patients at risk of re-admission before the occurrence using data driven analysis? Patient re-admission risk management has become critical for patients suffering from chronic wounds such as diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, and vascular ulcers. Understanding the risk & the factors that cause patient readmission can help care providers and patients avoid wound recurrences. Our work focuses on identifying patients who are at high risk of re-admission & determining the time period with in which a patient might get re-admitted. Frequent re-admissions add financial stress to the patient & Health plan and deteriorate the quality of life of the patient. Having this information can allow a provider to set up preventive measures that can delay, if not prevent, patients' re-admission. On a combined wound & episode-level data set of patient's wound care information, our extended autoprognosis achieves a recall of 92 and a precision of 92 for the predicting a patient's re-admission risk. For new patient class, precision and recall are as high as 91 and 98, respectively. We are also able to predict the patient's discharge event for a re-admission event to occur through our model with a MAE of 2.3 weeks.\n",

      "        The recent outbreak of SARS COV-2 gave us a unique opportunity to study for a non interventional and sustainable AI solution. Lung disease remains a major healthcare challenge with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The predominant lung disease was lung cancer. Until recently, the world has witnessed the global pandemic of COVID19, the Novel coronavirus outbreak. We have experienced how viral infection of lung and heart claimed thousands of lives worldwide. With the unprecedented advancement of Artificial Intelligence in recent years, Machine learning can be used to easily detect and classify medical imagery. It is much faster and most of the time more accurate than human radiologists. Once implemented, it is more cost-effective and time-saving. In our study, we evaluated the efficacy of Microsoft Cognitive Service to detect and classify COVID19 induced pneumonia from other Viral/Bacterial pneumonia based on X-Ray and CT images. We wanted to assess the implication and accuracy of the Automated ML-based Rapid Application Development (RAD) environment in the field of Medical Image diagnosis. This study will better equip us to respond with an ML-based diagnostic Decision Support System(DSS) for a Pandemic situation like COVID19. After optimization, the trained network achieved 96.8% Average Precision which was implemented as a Web Application for consumption. However, the same trained network did not perform the same like Web Application when ported to Smartphone for Real-time inference. Which was our main interest of study. The authors believe, there is scope for further study on this issue. One of the main goal of this study was to develop and evaluate the performance of AI-powered Smartphone-based Real-time Application. Facilitating primary diagnostic services in less equipped and understaffed rural healthcare centers of the world with unreliable internet service.\n",

      "        Automatic structuring of electronic medical records is of high demand for clinical workflow solutions to facilitate extraction, storage, and querying of patient care information. However, developing a scalable solution is extremely challenging, specifically for radiology reports, as most healthcare institutes use either no template or department/institute specific templates. Moreover, radiologists' reporting style varies from one to another as sentences are telegraphic and do not follow general English grammar rules. We present an ensemble method that consolidates the predictions of three models, capturing various attributes of textual information for automatic labeling of sentences with section labels. These three models are: 1) Focus Sentence model, capturing context of the target sentence; 2) Surrounding Context model, capturing the neighboring context of the target sentence; and finally, 3) Formatting/Layout model, aimed at learning report formatting cues. We utilize Bi-directional LSTMs, followed by sentence encoders, to acquire the context. Furthermore, we define several features that incorporate the structure of reports. We compare our proposed approach against multiple baselines and state-of-the-art approaches on a proprietary dataset as well as 100 manually annotated radiology notes from the MIMIC-III dataset, which we are making publicly available. Our proposed approach significantly outperforms other approaches by achieving 97.1% accuracy.\n",

      "        Efficient design of biological sequences will have a great impact across many industrial and healthcare domains. However, discovering improved sequences requires solving a difficult optimization problem. Traditionally, this challenge was approached by biologists through a model-free method known as \"directed evolution\", the iterative process of random mutation and selection. As the ability to build models that capture the sequence-to-function map improves, such models can be used as oracles to screen sequences before running experiments. In recent years, interest in better algorithms that effectively use such oracles to outperform model-free approaches has intensified. These span from approaches based on Bayesian Optimization, to regularized generative models and adaptations of reinforcement learning. In this work, we implement an open-source Fitness Landscape EXploration Sandbox (FLEXS: github.com/samsinai/FLEXS) environment to test and evaluate these algorithms based on their optimality, consistency, and robustness. Using FLEXS, we develop an easy-to-implement, scalable, and robust evolutionary greedy algorithm (AdaLead). Despite its simplicity, we show that AdaLead is a remarkably strong benchmark that out-competes more complex state of the art approaches in a variety of biologically motivated sequence design challenges.\n",

      "        Deep neural networks are becoming more and more popular due to their revolutionary success in diverse areas, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, the decision-making processes of these models are generally not interpretable to users. In various domains, such as healthcare, finance, or law, it is critical to know the reasons behind a decision made by an artificial intelligence system. Therefore, several directions for explaining neural models have recently been explored.\n",
      "  In this thesis, I investigate two major directions for explaining deep neural networks. The first direction consists of feature-based post-hoc explanatory methods, that is, methods that aim to explain an already trained and fixed model (post-hoc), and that provide explanations in terms of input features, such as tokens for text and superpixels for images (feature-based). The second direction consists of self-explanatory neural models that generate natural language explanations, that is, models that have a built-in module that generates explanations for the predictions of the model.\n",

      "        Explainability has been a goal for Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems since their conception, with the need for explainability growing as more complex AI models are increasingly used in critical, high-stakes settings such as healthcare. Explanations have often added to an AI system in a non-principled, post-hoc manner. With greater adoption of these systems and emphasis on user-centric explainability, there is a need for a structured representation that treats explainability as a primary consideration, mapping end user needs to specific explanation types and the system's AI capabilities. We design an explanation ontology to model both the role of explanations, accounting for the system and user attributes in the process, and the range of different literature-derived explanation types. We indicate how the ontology can support user requirements for explanations in the domain of healthcare. We evaluate our ontology with a set of competency questions geared towards a system designer who might use our ontology to decide which explanation types to include, given a combination of users' needs and a system's capabilities, both in system design settings and in real-time operations. Through the use of this ontology, system designers will be able to make informed choices on which explanations AI systems can and should provide.\n",
